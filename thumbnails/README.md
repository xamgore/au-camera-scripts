### Description

When a video is uploaded, its thumbnail must be chosen. Unfortunately a user interaction is required here, so we made a telegram bot. He sends three pictures and asks, which one should be used as a default.

### Installation  

```bash
# Install dependencies
sudo pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt

# Send thumbnails to telegram 
./offer.py

# Start the server
./server
```
