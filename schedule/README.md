## About

This project contains the schedule, stored in json format, and some important notes, connected to intellectual `MTS.*` files grouping.

##### TODO:

1. Which weeks are even / odd? Check it.
2. Find a library to work with dates in python
3. Write a method to get the parity of a week by a date (`2018-04-27 10:16:11+03:00`)
